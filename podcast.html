 <div class="card">
 **Linux, Daily** is a podcast released daily Monday through Friday at 7:00AM that talks about the very latest developments in the Linux world, with a particular focus on desktop environments.

 Episodes are usually under 10 minutes, and the podcast is meant as a nice way to keep up to date daily after waking up and whilst going to work or school.

 You can listen to it on a variety of closed-source platforms like Spotify, Apple Podcasts and so on. However, it's also available as a RSS to listen on any open-source podcasting application you like (such as AntennaPod, which I recommend).
