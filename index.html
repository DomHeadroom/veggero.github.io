                            **Niccolò Vé**


<div class="card">
I study [Mathematics](#otherskills/mathematics) in Genoa and Stockholm. I spend time translating definitions and proofs into colorful drawings that give better mathematical intuition. I do promotion and development for the open source organization [KDE](#linuxandcoding/kdedevelopment). I have a [Youtube channel](#linuxandcoding/niccoloveslinux) regarding Linux desktops and their designs. I have a [daily podcast](#linuxandcoding/linux,daily.) about the latest Linux news. I write Italian [poetry](#poetryandart/poetry). I upload [daily videos](#poetryandart/niccolovespoetry) on rap and metric on Tiktok and Instagram. I study [chess](#otherskills/chess) daily and play in tournaments. I'm a **boy scouts** leader in the CNGEI organization. I'm a students' representative at University and plan to join the Democratic Party in Italy. I love art. I have ambitious goals and an obsession with time management.

If you're particularly interested in me, see the [contacts](#contacts+curriculum/contacts) or my draft [curriculum]("#contacts+curriculum/draftcurriculum(initalian)") (currently, in Italian).

KDE Development
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="card">
I have joined KDE development roughly in 2018/2019. I was elected the goalkeeper of the **Consistency** goal during the Akademy of 2019. For the following three years I have worked towards making the style of Plasma and KDE apps as consistent as possible, with yearly talks at following Akademys regarding the ongoing process.

In this timeframe I've also implemented some nice user-facing features in Plasma: the **floating panels**, the **margin areas**, **adaptive transparency**, and I've also done a serious work on Plasma **shadows**. I've also produced a **panel refactoring** and I'm now focusing on maintaining the panel and its applets with some bugfixing effort.

I've contributed to the Promo group as well by helping writing announcements, preparing April Fools, organizing promotional videos and so on.

In the beginning of 2021 I have started a youtube channel regarding my involvement in KDE, which soon grew to be a more general channel about Linux. It has now  more than **10.000 subscribers**.

Linux, Daily.

<div class="card">
In September, 2022 I started a daily podcast about the latest developments in the Linux world. Although focused on Linux desktops mostly, it also covers most of the news about the Linux environment in general. It currently releases five episodes every week (one every weekday) and is completely free.

    You can listen to it on Spotify, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, but also using any open source RSS podcast reader.

Poetry and Art
===============================================================================

Poetry
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="card">
I write poetry almost daily. It is in Italian. Its main focus is love, and all the circumstances where it ends up hurting all the people involved instead of being a positive driving force. I also focus on rhymes and wordplay with sounds.

In 2019 I wrote a collection called **"Tutto l'Amore Brutto"** (which roughly translates to "All Ugly Love") which features many very short poems about a variety of fictional situations. This was rather early in my writing and only rarely do I read poems from this collection.

In 2020 I wrote a collection called **"Non Sono Che Suoni"** (which roughly translates to "Nothing But Sounds") which talks about a wet dream of a young boy. He dreams of approaching the girl he likes, then has flashbacks about the first time he met her, then gets lost into a variety of memories of her, eventually falling asleep with her. These poems are much longer, yet much less understandable. Although I think my rhyme-play peaked here, I basically never use these poems, for they're too obscure. I have commissioned one artist, Revelies, to draw five illustration for this collection.

Since 2021 I'm working on a more serious collection called (for now) **"Metrica e Ritmi di Ragazze che Crescono"** (which roughly translates to "Metric and Rhytms of Girls Growing Up"), containing fictional stories regarding girls facing the troubles in the grown-ups world which is changing around them. I plan to actually print and sell this, and also to contact different artists to make this not a poetry book, but rather a mix of a poetry and illustrations book.
</div>

Nicco Loves Poetry
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="card">
With the goal of growing an audience around poetry/rhymes/rap, I publish daily videos talking about rap and metric. My main medium here is Tiktok, which seem to react well to videos with informations about rap songs (at the time of writing, I have over **2000** followers there). I also sometimes try to upload on Instagram or my secondary Youtube channel as well, with less success.

Drawings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="card">
Sadly, I'm currently a terrible artist. This said,

- I am training my drawing skills for roughly half an hour daily with the goal of improving. I'm following DrawABox tutorials and doing the various excercises. I have no particular hurry.

- I have contacted some artists to commission them art for my poetry collections. The inherent limit here is my budget, as a student with no paycheck, but I do what I can :)

- I'm a big fan of AI-generated art, and I'd like to explore that more in the future. I'm really sad to see many artists argue against it, and I think (IMVHO) that many of them have a flawed idea on how these tools work.

Mathematics
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="card">
I'm currently at my third year of bachelor's. I like to try to re-elaborate textbook concepts to make them more visually intuitive, at the cost of formality. For fun, here's a couple of examples from simple Calculus:

******************************************************** A succession of numbers $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $L$ if, for each $\varepsilon$, there exist an element of the succession ($a_6$ in the example) after which all succession elements are distant to $L$ by less than $\varepsilon$.

********************************************************

********************************************************  All convergent sequences are bounded. If we pick any $\varepsilon$, we have by definition an element $a_n$ from which all following elements are within $(L+\varepsilon, L-\varepsilon)$; thus, they are bounded between these two varuel. All the elements *before* that element, instead, are a finite amount (from $a_1$ to $a_n$), which means that we can pick the largest and smallest values between those, and all of them will surely be bounded by these two values.

Chess
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="card">
I currently train chess daily! I do puzzles on Lichess, I play games there, and I study the book *100 Endgames You Must Know*. I only play on Lichess. At the time of writing, the ratings I have are, roughly:

 Rapid  | Blitz | Bullet
--------|-------|------
 1900   | 1700  | 1600
 [Lichess ratings]

I will start my first rated tournament in October, if everything goes well. I will update this section with my performances and results on rated tournaments.

Heads-up for anybody who'll play with me: I absolutely love playing the **Polish opening** with white and the **Scandinavian** (modern variation) with black, but please don't play the mainlines of these two openings, for they're so boring!

!!!
    You can find me in Lichess under the nickname `niccolove`!
